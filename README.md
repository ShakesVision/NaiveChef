This app has been developed as a course project demonstrating basic database CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and some basic queries.

As the requirement was to establish a database connection and do DBMS operations, this is still in Dev mode. Although, you can expect a slightly modified version with a little code refinement in the Google PlayStore, someday! :p
